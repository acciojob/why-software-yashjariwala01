	<h1>Why i want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p> i will share a story from where i thought i should be a developer,
		when i was in startup of freelancing platform aggregrator, most of the
		developers lack business acumen...and i think a software developer should 
		have a business acumen, cause at the end all the work they are doing is
		for increasing business and i though i have some business acumen so
		that i can help businesses grow </p>
